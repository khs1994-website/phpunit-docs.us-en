While PHP has no\ndedicated language feature for annotating source code, the usage of tags\nsuch as @annotation arguments in a documentation block has been\nestablished in the PHP community to annotate source code. In PHP\ndocumentation blocks are reflective: they can be accessed through the\nReflection API's getDocComment() method on the function, class,\nmethod, and attribute level. Applications such as PHPUnit use this\ninformation at runtime to configure their behaviour.\nNote\nA doc comment in PHP must start with /** and end with */.\nAnnotations in any other style of comment will be ignored.\nThis appendix shows all the varieties of annotations supported by\nPHPUnit.\n@author\nThe @author annotation is an alias for the @group annotation (see\nappendixes.annotations.group) and allows to filter tests based on\ntheir authors.\n@after\nThe @after annotation can be used to specify methods that should be\ncalled after each test method in a test case class.\n@afterClass\nThe @afterClass annotation can be used to specify static methods that\nshould be called after all test methods in a test class have been run to\nclean up shared fixtures.\n@backupGlobals\nPHPUnit can optionally backup all global and super-global variables\nbefore each test and restore this backup after each test.\nThe @backupGlobals enabled annotation can be used on the class level\nto enable this operation for all tests of a test case class:\nThe @backupGlobals annotation can also be used on the test method\nlevel. This allows for a fine-grained configuration of the backup and\nrestore operations:\n@backupStaticAttributes\nPHPUnit can optionally backup all static attributes in all declared\nclasses before each test and restore this backup after each test.\nThe @backupStaticAttributes enabled annotation can be used on the\nclass level to enable this operation for all tests of a test case class:\nThe @backupStaticAttributes annotation can also be used on the test\nmethod level. This allows for a fine-grained configuration of the backup\nand restore operations:\nuse PHPUnit\\Framework\\TestCase;\n\n/**\n * @backupStaticAttributes enabled\n */\nclass MyTest extends TestCase\n{\n    public function testThatInteractsWithStaticAttributes(): void\n    {\n        // ...\n    }\n\n    /**\n     * @backupStaticAttributes disabled\n     */\n    public function testThatDoesNotInteractWithStaticAttributes(): void\n    {\n        // ...\n    }\n}\nNote\n@backupStaticAttributes is limited by PHP internals and may cause\nunintended static values to persist and leak into subsequent tests in\nsome circumstances.\nSee fixtures.global-state for details.\n@before\nThe @before annotation can be used to specify methods that should be\ncalled before each test method in a test case class.\n@beforeClass\nThe @beforeClass annotation can be used to specify static methods that\nshould be called before any test methods in a test class are run to set\nup shared fixtures.\n@codeCoverageIgnore*\nThe @codeCoverageIgnore, @codeCoverageIgnoreStart and\n@codeCoverageIgnoreEnd annotations can be used to exclude lines of\ncode from the coverage analysis.\nFor usage see code-coverage-analysis.ignoring-code-blocks.\n@covers\nThe @covers annotation can be used in the test code to specify which\nparts of the code it is supposed to test:\n/**\n * @covers \\BankAccount\n */\npublic function testBalanceIsInitiallyZero(): void\n{\n    $this->assertSame(0, $this->ba->getBalance());\n}\nIf provided, this effectively filters the code coverage report to\ninclude executed code from the referenced code parts only. This will\nmake sure that code is only marked as covered if there are dedicated\ntests for it, but not if it used indirectly by the tests for a different\nclass, thus avoiding false positives for code coverage.\nThis annotation can be added to the docblock of the test class or the\nindividual test methods. The recommended way is to add the annotation to\nthe docblock of the test class, not to the docblock of the test methods.\nWhen the forceCoversAnnotation configuration option in the\nconfiguration file  is set to true, every\ntest method needs to have an associated @covers annotation (either on\nthe test class or the individual test method).\nappendixes.annotations.covers.tables.annotations shows the syntax of\nthe @covers annotation. The section\ncode-coverage-analysis.specifying-covered-parts provides longer\nexamples for using the annotation.\nPlease note that this annotation requires a fully-qualified class name\n(FQCN). To make this more obvious to the reader, it is recommended to\nuse a leading backslash (even if this not required for the annotation to\nwork correctly).\ntable\n\nAnnotations for specifying which methods are covered by a test\n\n\nAnnotation\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n@covers ClassName::methodName (not recommended)\nSpecifies that the annotated test method covers the specified method.\n\n\n@covers ClassName (recommended)\nSpecifies that the annotated test method covers all methods of a given class.\n\n\n@covers ClassName (not recommended)\nSpecifies that the annotated test method covers all methods of a given class and its parent class(es).\n\n\n@covers ClassName:: (not recommended)\nSpecifies that the annotated test method covers all public methods of a given class.\n\n\n@covers ClassName:: (not recommended)\nSpecifies that the annotated test method covers all protected methods of a given class.\n\n\n@covers ClassName:: (not recommended)\nSpecifies that the annotated test method covers all private methods of a given class.\n\n\n@covers ClassName:: (not recommended)\nSpecifies that the annotated test method covers all methods of a given class that are not public.\n\n\n@covers ClassName:: (not recommended)\nSpecifies that the annotated test method covers all methods of a given class that are not protected.\n\n\n@covers ClassName:: (not recommended)\nSpecifies that the annotated test method covers all methods of a given class that are not private.\n\n\n@covers ::functionName (recommended)\nSpecifies that the annotated test method covers the specified global function.\n\n\n\n\n@coversDefaultClass\nThe @coversDefaultClass annotation can be used to specify a default\nnamespace or class name. That way long names don't need to be repeated\nfor every @covers annotation. See\nappendixes.annotations.examples.CoversDefaultClassTest.php.\nPlease note that this annotation requires a fully-qualified class name\n(FQCN). To make this more obvious to the reader, it is recommended to\nuse a leading backslash (even if this not required for the annotation to\nwork correctly).\npublicMethod();\n    }\n}\n@coversNothing\nThe @coversNothing annotation can be used in the test code to specify\nthat no code coverage information will be recorded for the annotated\ntest case.\nThis can be used for integration testing. See\ncode-coverage-analysis.specifying-covered-parts.examples.GuestbookIntegrationTest.php\nfor an example.\nThe annotation can be used on the class and the method level and will\noverride any @covers tags.\n@dataProvider\nA test method can accept arbitrary arguments. These arguments are to be\nprovided by one or more data provider methods (provider() in\nwriting-tests-for-phpunit.data-providers.examples.DataTest.php). The\ndata provider method to be used is specified using the @dataProvider\nannotation.\nSee writing-tests-for-phpunit.data-providers for more details.\n@depends\nPHPUnit supports the declaration of explicit dependencies between test\nmethods. Such dependencies do not define the order in which the test\nmethods are to be executed but they allow the returning of an instance\nof the test fixture by a producer and passing it to the dependent\nconsumers. writing-tests-for-phpunit.examples.StackTest2.php shows how\nto use the @depends annotation to express dependencies between test\nmethods.\nSee writing-tests-for-phpunit.test-dependencies for more details.\n@doesNotPerformAssertions\nPrevents a test that performs no assertions from being considered risky.\n@group\nA test can be tagged as belonging to one or more groups using the\n@group annotation like this\nThe @group annotation can also be provided for the test class. It is\nthen \"inherited\" to all test methods of that test class.\nTests can be selected for execution based on groups using the --group\nand --exclude-group options of the command-line test runner or using\nthe respective directives of the XML configuration file.\n@large\nThe @large annotation is an alias for @group large.\nIf the PHP_Invoker package is installed and strict mode is enabled, a\nlarge test will fail if it takes longer than 60 seconds to execute. This\ntimeout is configurable via the timeoutForLargeTests attribute in the\nXML configuration file.\n@medium\nThe @medium annotation is an alias for @group medium. A medium test\nmust not depend on a test marked as @large.\nIf the PHP_Invoker package is installed and strict mode is enabled, a\nmedium test will fail if it takes longer than 10 seconds to execute.\nThis timeout is configurable via the timeoutForMediumTests attribute\nin the XML configuration file.\n@preserveGlobalState\nWhen a test is run in a separate process, PHPUnit will attempt to\npreserve the global state from the parent process by serializing all\nglobals in the parent process and unserializing them in the child\nprocess. This can cause problems if the parent process contains globals\nthat are not serializable. To fix this, you can prevent PHPUnit from\npreserving global state with the @preserveGlobalState annotation.\n@requires\nThe @requires annotation can be used to skip tests when common\npreconditions, like the PHP Version or installed extensions, are not\nmet.\nA complete list of possibilities and examples can be found at\nincomplete-and-skipped-tests.requires.tables.api\n@runTestsInSeparateProcesses\nIndicates that all tests in a test class should be run in a separate PHP\nprocess.\nNote: By default, PHPUnit will attempt to preserve the global state\nfrom the parent process by serializing all globals in the parent process\nand unserializing them in the child process. This can cause problems if\nthe parent process contains globals that are not serializable. See\nappendixes.annotations.preserveGlobalState for information on how to\nfix this.\n@runInSeparateProcess\nIndicates that a test should be run in a separate PHP process.\nNote: By default, PHPUnit will attempt to preserve the global state\nfrom the parent process by serializing all globals in the parent process\nand unserializing them in the child process. This can cause problems if\nthe parent process contains globals that are not serializable. See\nappendixes.annotations.preserveGlobalState for information on how to\nfix this.\n@small\nThe @small annotation is an alias for @group small. A small test\nmust not depend on a test marked as @medium or @large.\nIf the PHP_Invoker package is installed and strict mode is enabled, a\nsmall test will fail if it takes longer than 1 second to execute. This\ntimeout is configurable via the timeoutForSmallTests attribute in the\nXML configuration file.\nNote\nTests need to be explicitly annotated by either @small, @medium, or\n@large to enable run time limits.\n@test\nAs an alternative to prefixing your test method names with test, you\ncan use the @test annotation in a method's DocBlock to mark it as a\ntest method.\n/**\n * @test\n */\npublic function initialBalanceShouldBe0(): void\n{\n    $this->assertSame(0, $this->ba->getBalance());\n}\n@testdox\nSpecifies an alternative description used when generating the agile\ndocumentation sentences.\nThe @testdox annotation can be applied to both test classes and test\nmethods.\nassertSame(0, $this->ba->getBalance());\n    }\n}\nNote\nPrior to PHPUnit 7.0 (due to a bug in the annotation parsing), using the\n@testdox annotation also activated the behaviour of the @test\nannotation.\nWhen using the @testdox annotation at method level with a\n@dataProvider you may use the method parameters as placeholders in\nyour alternative description.\n/**\n * @dataProvider additionProvider\n * @testdox Adding $a to $b results in $expected\n */\npublic function testAdd($a, $b, $expected)\n{\n    $this->assertSame($expected, $a + $b);\n}\n\npublic function additionProvider()\n{\n    return [\n        [0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 1, 1],\n        [1, 0, 1],\n        [1, 1, 3]\n    ];\n}\n@testWith\nInstead of implementing a method for use with @dataProvider, you can\ndefine a data set using the @testWith annotation.\nA data set consists of one or many elements. To define a data set with\nmultiple elements, define each element in a separate line. Each element\nof the data set must be an array defined in JSON.\nSee writing-tests-for-phpunit.data-providers to learn more about\npassing a set of data to a test.\n/**\n * @testWith [\"test\", 4]\n *           [\"longer-string\", 13]\n */\npublic function testStringLength(string $input, int $expectedLength): void\n{\n    $this->assertSame($expectedLength, strlen($input));\n}\nAn object representation in JSON will be converted into an associative\narray.\n/**\n * @testWith [{\"day\": \"monday\", \"conditions\": \"sunny\"}, [\"day\", \"conditions\"]]\n */\npublic function testArrayKeys(array $array, array $keys): void\n{\n    $this->assertSame($keys, array_keys($array));\n}\n@ticket\nThe @ticket annotation is an alias for the @group annotation (see\nappendixes.annotations.group) and allows to filter tests based on\ntheir ticket ID.\n@uses\nThe @uses annotation specifies code which will be executed by a test,\nbut is not intended to be covered by the test. A good example is a value\nobject which is necessary for testing a unit of code.\n/**\n * @covers \\BankAccount\n * @uses   \\Money\n */\npublic function testMoneyCanBeDepositedInAccount(): void\n{\n    // ...\n}\ncode-coverage-analysis.specifying-covered-parts.examples.InvoiceTest.php\nshows another example.\nIn addition to being helpful for persons reading the code, this\nannotation is useful in strict coverage mode where unintentionally\ncovered code will cause a test to fail. See\nrisky-tests.unintentionally-covered-code for more information\nregarding strict coverage mode.\nPlease note that this annotation requires a fully-qualified class name\n(FQCN). To make this more obvious to the reader, it is recommended to\nuse a leading backslash (even if this is not required for the annotation\nto work correctly).\n"},"assertions.html":{"url":"assertions.html","title":"Assertions","keywords":"","body":"Assertions\nThis appendix lists the various assertion methods that are available.\nStatic vs. Non-Static Usage of Assertion Methods\nPHPUnit's assertions are implemented in PHPUnit\\Framework\\Assert.\nPHPUnit\\Framework\\TestCase inherits from PHPUnit\\Framework\\Assert.\nThe assertion methods are declared static and can be invoked from any\ncontext using PHPUnit\\Framework\\Assert::assertTrue(), for instance, or\nusing $this->assertTrue() or self::assertTrue(), for instance, in a\nclass that extends PHPUnit\\Framework\\TestCase. You can even use global\nfunction wrappers such as assertTrue().\nA common question, especially from developers new to PHPUnit, is whether\nusing $this->assertTrue() or self::assertTrue(), for instance, is\n\"the right way\" to invoke an assertion. The short answer is: there is no\nright way. And there is no wrong way, either. It is a matter of personal\npreference.\nFor most people it just \"feels right\" to use $this->assertTrue()\nbecause the test method is invoked on a test object. The fact that the\nassertion methods are declared static allows for (re)using them outside\nthe scope of a test object. Lastly, the global function wrappers allow\ndevelopers to type less characters (assertTrue() instead of\n$this->assertTrue() or self::assertTrue()).\nassertArrayHasKey()\nassertArrayHasKey(mixed $key, array $array[, string $message = ''])\nReports an error identified by $message if $array does not have the\n$key.\nassertArrayNotHasKey() is the inverse of this assertion and takes the\nsame arguments.\nassertArrayHasKey('foo', ['bar' => 'baz']);\n    }\n}\n$ phpunit ArrayHasKeyTest PHPUnit .0 by Sebastian Bergmann and\ncontributors.\nF\nTime: 0 seconds, Memory: 5.00Mb\nThere was 1 failure:\n1) ArrayHasKeyTest::testFailure Failed asserting that an array has the\nkey 'foo'.\n/home/sb/ArrayHasKeyTest.php:6\nFAILURES!

A program with high code coverage has been more thoroughly\ntested and has a lower chance of containing software bugs than a\nprogram with low code coverage.\n\nIn this chapter you will learn all about PHPUnit's code coverage\nfunctionality that provides an insight into what parts of the production\ncode are executed when the tests are run. It makes use of the\nphp-code-coverage\ncomponent, which in turn leverages the code coverage functionality\nprovided by the Xdebug or\nPCOV extensions for PHP or by\nPHPDBG.\nNote\nIf you see a warning while running tests that no code coverage driver is\navailable, it means that you are using the PHP CLI binary (php) and do\nnot have Xdebug or PCOV loaded.\nPHPUnit can generate an HTML-based code coverage report as well as\nXML-based logfiles with code coverage information in various formats\n(Clover, Crap4J, PHPUnit). Code coverage information can also be\nreported as text (and printed to STDOUT) and exported as PHP code for\nfurther processing.\nPlease refer to textui for a list of command line switches that\ncontrol code coverage functionality as well as\nappendixes.configuration.logging for the relevant configuration\nsettings.\nSoftware Metrics for Code Coverage\nVarious software metrics exist to measure code coverage:\nLine Coverage\n\nThe Line Coverage software metric measures whether each executable\nline was executed.\n\nBranch Coverage\n\nThe Branch Coverage software metric measures whether the boolean\nexpression of each control structure evaluated to both true and\nfalse while running the test suite.\n\nPath Coverage\n\nThe Path Coverage software metric measures whether each of the\npossible execution paths in a function or method has been followed\nwhile running the test suite. An execution path is a unique sequence\nof branches from the entry of the function or method to its exit.\n\nFunction and Method Coverage\n\nThe Function and Method Coverage software metric measures whether\neach function or method has been invoked. php-code-coverage only\nconsiders a function or method as covered when all of its executable\nlines are covered.\n\nClass and Trait Coverage\n\nThe Class and Trait Coverage software metric measures whether each\nmethod of a class or trait is covered. php-code-coverage only\nconsiders a class or trait as covered when all of its methods are\ncovered.\n\nChange Risk Anti-Patterns (CRAP) Index\n\nThe Change Risk Anti-Patterns (CRAP) Index is calculated based on\nthe cyclomatic complexity and code coverage of a unit of code. Code\nthat is not too complex and has an adequate test coverage will have a\nlow CRAP index. The CRAP index can be lowered by writing tests and by\nrefactoring the code to lower its complexity.\n\nIncluding Files\nIt is mandatory to configure a filter for telling PHPUnit which\nsourcecode files to include in the code coverage report. This can either\nbe done using the --coverage-filter command line \noption or via the configuration file (see\nappendixes.configuration.coverage.include).\nThe includeUncoveredFilesInCodeCoverageReport and\nprocessUncoveredFilesForCodeCoverageReport configuration settings are\navailable to configure how the filter is used:\n\nincludeUncoveredFilesInCodeCoverageReport=\"false\" means that only\nfiles that have at least one line of executed code are included in\nthe code coverage report\nincludeUncoveredFilesInCodeCoverageReport=\"true\" (default) means\nthat all files are included in the code coverage report even if not\na single line of code of such a file is executed\nprocessUncoveredFilesForCodeCoverageReport=\"false\" (default) means\nthat a file that has no executed lines of code will be added to the\ncode coverage report (if\nincludeUncoveredFilesInCodeCoverageReport=\"true\" is set) but it\nwill not be loaded by PHPUnit and it will therefore not be analysed\nfor correct executable lines of code information\nprocessUncoveredFilesForCodeCoverageReport=\"true\" means that a\nfile that has no executed lines of code will be loaded by PHPUnit so\nthat it can be analysed for correct executable lines of code\ninformation\n\nNote\nPlease note that the loading of sourcecode files that is performed when\nprocessUncoveredFilesForCodeCoverageReport=\"true\" is set can cause\nproblems when a sourcecode file contains code outside the scope of a\nclass or function, for instance.\nIgnoring Code Blocks\nSometimes you have blocks of code that you cannot test and that you may\nwant to ignore during code coverage analysis. PHPUnit lets you do this\nusing the @codeCoverageIgnore, @codeCoverageIgnoreStart and\n@codeCoverageIgnoreEnd annotations as shown in\ncode-coverage-analysis.ignoring-code-blocks.examples.Sample.php.\nThe ignored lines of code (marked as ignored using the annotations) are\ncounted as executed (if they are executable) and will not be\nhighlighted.\nSpecifying Covered Code Parts\nThe @covers annotation (see the\nannotation documentation )\ncan be used in the test code to specify which code parts a test class\n(or test method) wants to test. If provided, this effectively filters\nthe code coverage report to include executed code from the referenced\ncode parts only.\ncode-coverage-analysis.specifying-covered-parts.examples.InvoiceTest.php\nshows an example.\nNote\nIf a method is specificed with the @covers annotation, only the\nreferenced method will be considered as covered, but not methods called\nby this method. Hence, when a covered method is refactored using the\nextract method refactoring, corresponding @covers annotations need\nto be added. This is the reason it is recommended to use this annotation\nwith class scope, not with method scope.\ninvoice = new Invoice;\n    }\n\n    public function testAmountInitiallyIsEmpty(): void\n    {\n        $this->assertEquals(new Money, $this->invoice->getAmount());\n    }\n}\n\nba = new BankAccount;\n    }\n\n    /**\n     * @covers \\BankAccount::getBalance\n     */\n    public function testBalanceIsInitiallyZero(): void\n    {\n        $this->assertSame(0, $this->ba->getBalance());\n    }\n\n    /**\n     * @covers \\BankAccount::withdrawMoney\n     */\n    public function testBalanceCannotBecomeNegative(): void\n    {\n        try {\n            $this->ba->withdrawMoney(1);\n        }\n\n        catch (BankAccountException $e) {\n            $this->assertSame(0, $this->ba->getBalance());\n\n            return;\n        }\n\n        $this->fail();\n    }\n\n    /**\n     * @covers \\BankAccount::depositMoney\n     */\n    public function testBalanceCannotBecomeNegative2(): void\n    {\n        try {\n            $this->ba->depositMoney(-1);\n        }\n\n        catch (BankAccountException $e) {\n            $this->assertSame(0, $this->ba->getBalance());\n\n            return;\n        }\n\n        $this->fail();\n    }\n\n    /**\n     * @covers \\BankAccount::getBalance\n     * @covers \\BankAccount::depositMoney\n     * @covers \\BankAccount::withdrawMoney\n     */\n    public function testDepositWithdrawMoney(): void\n    {\n        $this->assertSame(0, $this->ba->getBalance());\n        $this->ba->depositMoney(1);\n        $this->assertSame(1, $this->ba->getBalance());\n        $this->ba->withdrawMoney(1);\n        $this->assertSame(0, $this->ba->getBalance());\n    }\n}\nIt is also possible to specify that a test should not cover any method\nby using the @coversNothing annotation (see\nappendixes.annotations.coversNothing). This can be helpful when\nwriting integration tests to make sure you only generate code coverage\nwith unit tests.\naddEntry(\"suzy\", \"Hello world!\");\n\n        $queryTable = $this->getConnection()->createQueryTable(\n            'guestbook', 'SELECT * FROM guestbook'\n        );\n\n        $expectedTable = $this->createFlatXmlDataSet(\"expectedBook.xml\")\n                              ->getTable(\"guestbook\");\n\n        $this->assertTablesEqual($expectedTable, $queryTable);\n    }\n}\nEdge Cases\nThis section shows noteworthy edge cases that lead to confusing code\ncoverage information.\n"},"configuration.html":{"url":"configuration.html","title":"Configuration","keywords":"","body":"The XML Configuration File\nThe  Element\nThe backupGlobals Attribute\nPossible values: true or false (default: false)\nPHPUnit can optionally backup all global and super-global variables\nbefore each test and restore this backup after each test.\nThis attribute configures this operation for all tests.

Definitions\n\n   a. \"Adaptation\" means a work based upon the Work, or upon the\n      Work and other pre-existing works, such as a translation,\n      adaptation, derivative work, arrangement of music or other\n      alterations of a literary or artistic work, or phonogram or\n      performance and includes cinematographic adaptations or any\n      other form in which the Work may be recast, transformed, or\n      adapted including in any form recognizably derived from the\n      original, except that a work that constitutes a Collection\n      will not be considered an Adaptation for the purpose of this\n      License. For the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a\n      musical work, performance or phonogram, the synchronization of\n      the Work in timed-relation with a moving image (\"synching\")\n      will be considered an Adaptation for the purpose of this\n      License.\n\n   b. \"Collection\" means a collection of literary or artistic works,\n      such as encyclopedias and anthologies, or performances,\n      phonograms or broadcasts, or other works or subject matter\n      other than works listed in Section 1(f) below, which, by\n      reason of the selection and arrangement of their contents,\n      constitute intellectual creations, in which the Work is\n      included in its entirety in unmodified form along with one or\n      more other contributions, each constituting separate and\n      independent works in themselves, which together are assembled\n      into a collective whole. A work that constitutes a Collection\n      will not be considered an Adaptation (as defined above) for\n      the purposes of this License.\n\n   c. \"Distribute\" means to make available to the public the\n      original and copies of the Work or Adaptation, as appropriate,\n      through sale or other transfer of ownership.\n\n   d. \"Licensor\" means the individual, individuals, entity or\n      entities that offer(s) the Work under the terms of this License.\n\n   e. \"Original Author\" means, in the case of a literary or artistic\n      work, the individual, individuals, entity or entities who\n      created the Work or if no individual or entity can be\n      identified, the publisher; and in addition (i) in the case of\n      a performance the actors, singers, musicians, dancers, and\n      other persons who act, sing, deliver, declaim, play in,\n      interpret or otherwise perform literary or artistic works or\n      expressions of folklore; (ii) in the case of a phonogram the\n      producer being the person or legal entity who first fixes the\n      sounds of a performance or other sounds; and, (iii) in the\n      case of broadcasts, the organization that transmits the\n      broadcast.\n\n   f. \"Work\" means the literary and/or artistic work offered under\n      the terms of this License including without limitation any\n      production in the literary, scientific and artistic domain,\n      whatever may be the mode or form of its expression including\n      digital form, such as a book, pamphlet and other writing; a\n      lecture, address, sermon or other work of the same nature; a\n      dramatic or dramatico-musical work; a choreographic work or\n      entertainment in dumb show; a musical composition with or\n      without words; a cinematographic work to which are assimilated\n      works expressed by a process analogous to cinematography; a\n      work of drawing, painting, architecture, sculpture, engraving\n      or lithography; a photographic work to which are assimilated\n      works expressed by a process analogous to photography; a work\n      of applied art; an illustration, map, plan, sketch or three-\n      dimensional work relative to geography, topography,\n      architecture or science; a performance; a broadcast; a\n      phonogram; a compilation of data to the extent it is protected\n      as a copyrightable work; or a work performed by a variety or\n      circus performer to the extent it is not otherwise considered\n      a literary or artistic work.\n\n   g. \"You\" means an individual or entity exercising rights under\n      this License who has not previously violated the terms of\n      this License with respect to the Work, or who has received\n      express permission from the Licensor to exercise rights under\n      this License despite a previous violation.\n\n   h. \"Publicly Perform\" means to perform public recitations of the\n      Work and to communicate to the public those public\n      recitations, by any means or process, including by wire or\n      wireless means or public digital performances; to make\n      available to the public Works in such a way that members of\n      the public may access these Works from a place and at a place\n      individually chosen by them; to perform the Work to the public\n      by any means or process and the communication to the public of\n      the performances of the Work, including by public digital\n      performance; to broadcast and rebroadcast the Work by any\n      means including signs, sounds or images.\n\n   i. \"Reproduce\" means to make copies of the Work by any means\n      including without limitation by sound or visual recordings and\n      the right of fixation and reproducing fixations of the Work,\n      including storage of a protected performance or phonogram in\n      digital form or other electronic medium.\n\n2. Fair Dealing Rights. Nothing in this License is intended to\n   reduce, limit, or restrict any uses free from copyright or rights\n   arising from limitations or exceptions that are provided for in\n   connection with the copyright protection under copyright law or\n   other applicable laws.\n\n3. License Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this\n   License, Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free,\n   non-exclusive, perpetual (for the duration of the applicable\n   copyright) license to exercise the rights in the Work as stated\n   below:\n\n   a. to Reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or\n      more Collections, and to Reproduce the Work as incorporated\n      in the Collections;\n\n   b. to create and Reproduce Adaptations provided that any such\n      Adaptation, including any translation in any medium, takes\n      reasonable steps to clearly label, demarcate or otherwise\n      identify that changes were made to the original Work. For\n      example, a translation could be marked \"The original work was\n      translated from English to Spanish,\" or a modification could\n      indicate \"The original work has been modified.\";\n\n   c. to Distribute and Publicly Perform the Work including as\n      incorporated in Collections; and,\n\n   d. to Distribute and Publicly Perform Adaptations.\n\n   e. For the avoidance of doubt:\n\n      i. Non-waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those\n         jurisdictions in which the right to collect royalties\n         through any statutory or compulsory licensing scheme cannot\n         be waived, the Licensor reserves the exclusive right to\n         collect such royalties for any exercise by You of the\n         rights granted under this License;\n\n      ii. Waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those\n          jurisdictions in which the right to collect royalties\n          through any statutory or compulsory licensing scheme can\n          be waived, the Licensor waives the exclusive right to\n          collect such royalties for any exercise by You of the\n          rights granted under this License; and,\n\n      iii. Voluntary License Schemes. The Licensor waives the right\n           to collect royalties, whether individually or, in the\n           event that the Licensor is a member of a collecting\n           society that administers voluntary licensing schemes, via\n           that society, from any exercise by You of the rights\n           granted under this License.\n\nThe above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether\nnow known or hereafter devised. The above rights include the right\nto make such modifications as are technically necessary to exercise\nthe rights in other media and formats. Subject to Section 8(f), all\nrights not expressly granted by Licensor are hereby reserved.\n\n4. Restrictions. The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly\n   made subject to and limited by the following restrictions:\n\n   a. You may Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work only under the\n      terms of this License. You must include a copy of, or the\n      Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) for, this License with every\n      copy of the Work You Distribute or Publicly Perform. You may\n      not offer or impose any terms on the Work that restrict the\n      terms of this License or the ability of the recipient of the\n      Work to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under\n      the terms of the License. You may not sublicense the Work. You\n      must keep intact all notices that refer to this License and to\n      the disclaimer of warranties with every copy of the Work You\n      Distribute or Publicly Perform. When You Distribute or\n      Publicly Perform the Work, You may not impose any effective\n      technological measures on the Work that restrict the ability\n      of a recipient of the Work from You to exercise the rights\n      granted to that recipient under the terms of the License. This\n      Section 4(a) applies to the Work as incorporated in a\n      Collection, but this does not require the Collection apart\n      from the Work itself to be made subject to the terms of this\n      License. If You create a Collection, upon notice from any\n      Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the\n      Collection any credit as required by Section 4(b), as\n      requested. If You create an Adaptation, upon notice from any\n      Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the\n      Adaptation any credit as required by Section 4(b), as requested.\n\n   b. If You Distribute, or Publicly Perform the Work or any\n      Adaptations or Collections, You must, unless a request has\n      been made pursuant to Section 4(a), keep intact all copyright\n      notices for the Work and provide, reasonable to the medium or\n      means You are utilizing: (i) the name of the Original Author\n      (or pseudonym, if applicable) if supplied, and/or if the\n      Original Author and/or Licensor designate another party or\n      parties (e.g., a sponsor institute, publishing entity,\n      journal) for attribution (\"Attribution Parties\") in Licensor's\n      copyright notice, terms of service or by other reasonable\n      means, the name of such party or parties; (ii) the title of\n      the Work if supplied; (iii) to the extent reasonably\n      practicable, the URI, if any, that Licensor specifies to be\n      associated with the Work, unless such URI does not refer to\n      the copyright notice or licensing information for the Work;\n      and (iv), consistent with Section 3(b), in the case of an\n      Adaptation, a credit identifying the use of the Work in the\n      Adaptation (e.g., \"French translation of the Work by Original\n      Author,\" or \"Screenplay based on original Work by Original\n      Author\"). The credit required by this Section 4 (b) may be\n      implemented in any reasonable manner; provided, however, that\n      in the case of a Adaptation or Collection, at a minimum such\n      credit will appear, if a credit for all contributing authors\n      of the Adaptation or Collection appears, then as part of these\n      credits and in a manner at least as prominent as the credits\n      for the other contributing authors. For the avoidance of\n      doubt, You may only use the credit required by this Section\n      for the purpose of attribution in the manner set out above\n      and, by exercising Your rights under this License, You may not\n      implicitly or explicitly assert or imply any connection with,\n      sponsorship or endorsement by the Original Author, Licensor\n      and/or Attribution Parties, as appropriate, of You or Your use\n      of the Work, without the separate, express prior written\n      permission of the Original Author, Licensor and/or\n      Attribution Parties.\n\n   c. Except as otherwise agreed in writing by the Licensor or as\n      may be otherwise permitted by applicable law, if You\n      Reproduce, Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work either by\n      itself or as part of any Adaptations or Collections, You must\n      not distort, mutilate, modify or take other derogatory action\n      in relation to the Work which would be prejudicial to the\n      Original Author's honor or reputation. Licensor agrees that in\n      those jurisdictions (e.g. Japan), in which any exercise of the\n      right granted in Section 3(b) of this License (the right to\n      make Adaptations) would be deemed to be a distortion,\n      mutilation, modification or other derogatory action\n      prejudicial to the Original Author's honor and reputation, the\n      Licensor will waive or not assert, as appropriate, this\n      Section, to the fullest extent permitted by the applicable\n      national law, to enable You to reasonably exercise Your right\n      under Section 3(b) of this License (right to make Adaptations)\n      but not otherwise.\n\n5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer\n\nUNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING,\nLICENSOR OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR\nWARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED,\nSTATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF\nTITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE,\nNONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS,\nACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT\nDISCOVERABLE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF\nIMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\n\n6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY\n   APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY\n   LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE\n   OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF\n   THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY\n   OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n\n7. Termination\n\n   a. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate\n      automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this\n      License. Individuals or entities who have received Adaptations\n      or Collections from You under this License, however, will not\n      have their licenses terminated provided such individuals or\n      entities remain in full compliance with those licenses.\n      Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will survive any termination of\n      this License.\n\n   b. Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted\n      here is perpetual (for the duration of the applicable\n      copyright in the Work). Notwithstanding the above, Licensor\n      reserves the right to release the Work under different license\n      terms or to stop distributing the Work at any time; provided,\n      however that any such election will not serve to withdraw this\n      License (or any other license that has been, or is required to\n      be, granted under the terms of this License), and this License\n      will continue in full force and effect unless terminated as\n      stated above.\n\n8. Miscellaneous\n\n   a. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work or a\n      Collection, the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to\n      the Work on the same terms and conditions as the license\n      granted to You under this License.\n\n   b. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation,\n      Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the original\n      Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted\n      to You under this License.\n\n   c. If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable\n      under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or\n      enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this License,\n      and without further action by the parties to this agreement,\n      such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent\n      necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.\n\n   d. No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived\n      and no breach consented to unless such waiver or consent shall\n      be in writing and signed by the party to be charged with such\n      waiver or consent.\n\n   e. This License constitutes the entire agreement between the\n      parties with respect to the Work licensed here. There are no\n      understandings, agreements or representations with respect to\n      the Work not specified here. Licensor shall not be bound by\n      any additional provisions that may appear in any communication\n      from You. This License may not be modified without the mutual\n      written agreement of the Licensor and You.\n\n   f.

Here are\ncommon starting points to extend PHPUnit.\nSubclass PHPUnit\\Framework\\TestCase\nWrite custom assertions and utility methods in an abstract subclass of\nPHPUnit\\Framework\\TestCase and derive your test case classes from that\nclass. This is one of the easiest ways to extend PHPUnit.\nWrite custom assertions\nWhen writing custom assertions it is the best practice to follow how\nPHPUnit's own assertions are implemented. As you can see in\nextending-phpunit.examples.Assert.php, the assertTrue() method is a\nwrapper around the isTrue() and assertThat() methods: isTrue()\ncreates a matcher object that is passed on to assertThat() for\nevaluation.\nextending-phpunit.examples.IsTrue.php shows how\nPHPUnit\\Framework\\Constraint\\IsTrue extends the abstract base class\nfor matcher objects (or constraints), PHPUnit\\Framework\\Constraint.\nThe effort of implementing the assertTrue() and isTrue() methods as\nwell as the PHPUnit\\Framework\\Constraint\\IsTrue class yields the\nbenefit that assertThat() automatically takes care of evaluating the\nassertion and bookkeeping tasks such as counting it for statistics.\nFurthermore, the isTrue() method can be used as a matcher when\nconfiguring mock objects.\nExtending the TestRunner\nPHPUnit's test runner can be extended by registering objects that\nimplement one or more of the following interfaces:\n\nAfterIncompleteTestHook\nAfterLastTestHook\nAfterRiskyTestHook\nAfterSkippedTestHook\nAfterSuccessfulTestHook\nAfterTestErrorHook\nAfterTestFailureHook\nAfterTestWarningHook\nAfterTestHook\nBeforeFirstTestHook\nBeforeTestHook\n\nEach \"hook\", meaning each of the interfaces listed above, represents an\nevent that can occur while the tests are being executed.\nSee appendixes.configuration.extensions for details on how to register\nextensions in PHPUnit's XML configuration.\nextending-phpunit.examples.TestRunnerExtension shows an example for an\nextension implementing BeforeFirstTestHook and AfterLastTestHook:\nConfiguring extensions\nYou can configure PHPUnit extensions, assuming the extension accepts\nconfiguration values.\nextending-phpunit.examples.TestRunnerConfigurableExtension shows an\nexample how to make an extension configurable, by adding an\n__constructor() definition to the extension class:\nconfig_value_1 = $config_1;\n        $this->config_value_2 = $config_2;\n    }\n\n    public function executeBeforeFirstTest(): void\n    {\n        if (strlen($this->config_value_1) {\n            echo 'Testing with configuration value: ' . $this->config_value_1;\n        }\n    }\n\n    public function executeAfterLastTest(): void\n    {\n        if ($this->config_value_2 > 10) {\n            echo 'Second config value is OK!';\n        }\n    }\n}\nTo input configuration to the extension via XML, the XML configuration\nfile's extensions section needs to be updated to have configuration\nvalues, as shown in\nextending-phpunit.examples.TestRunnerConfigurableExtensionConfig:\n\n    \n    \n        \n            Hello world!\n            15\n        \n    \n\nSee appendixes.configuration.extensions.extension.arguments for\ndetails on how to use the arguments configuration.\nRemember: all configuration is optional, so make sure your extension\neither has sane defaults in place, or that it disables itself in case\nconfiguration is missing.\n"},"fixtures.html":{"url":"fixtures.html","title":"Fixtures","keywords":"","body":"Fixtures\nOne of the most time-consuming parts of writing tests is writing the\ncode to set the world up in a known state and then return it to its\noriginal state when the test is complete. This known state is called the\nfixture of the test.\nIn writing-tests-for-phpunit.examples.StackTest.php, the fixture was\nthe array that is stored in the $stack variable. Most of the time,\nthough, the fixture will be more complex than a simple array, and the\namount of code needed to set it up will grow accordingly. The actual\ncontent of the test gets lost in the noise of setting up the fixture.\nThis problem gets even worse when you write several tests with similar\nfixtures. Without some help from the testing framework, we would have to\nduplicate the code that sets up the fixture for each test we write.\nPHPUnit supports sharing the setup code. Before a test method is run, a\ntemplate method called setUp() is invoked. setUp() is where you\ncreate the objects against which you will test. Once the test method has\nfinished running, whether it succeeded or failed, another template\nmethod called tearDown() is invoked. tearDown() is where you clean\nup the objects against which you tested.\nIn writing-tests-for-phpunit.examples.StackTest2.php we used the\nproducer-consumer relationship between tests to share a fixture. This is\nnot always desired or even possible. fixtures.examples.StackTest.php\nshows how we can write the tests of the StackTest in such a way that\nnot the fixture itself is reused but the code that creates it. First we\ndeclare the instance variable, $stack, that we are going to use\ninstead of a method-local variable. Then we put the creation of the\narray fixture into the setUp() method. Finally, we remove the\nredundant code from the test methods and use the newly introduced\ninstance variable, $this->stack, instead of the method-local variable\n$stack with the assertSame() assertion method.\nstack = [];\n    }\n\n    public function testEmpty(): void\n    {\n        $this->assertTrue(empty($this->stack));\n    }\n\n    public function testPush(): void\n    {\n        array_push($this->stack, 'foo');\n\n        $this->assertSame('foo', $this->stack[count($this->stack)-1]);\n        $this->assertFalse(empty($this->stack));\n    }\n\n    public function testPop(): void\n    {\n        array_push($this->stack, 'foo');\n\n        $this->assertSame('foo', array_pop($this->stack));\n        $this->assertTrue(empty($this->stack));\n    }\n}\nThe setUp() and tearDown() template methods are run once for each\ntest method (and on fresh instances) of the test case class.\nIn addition, the setUpBeforeClass() and tearDownAfterClass()\ntemplate methods are called before the first test of the test case class\nis run and after the last test of the test case class is run,\nrespectively.\nThe example below shows all template methods that are available in a\ntest case class.\nassertTrue(true);\n    }\n\n    public function testTwo(): void\n    {\n        fwrite(STDOUT, __METHOD__ . \"\\n\");\n        $this->assertTrue(false);\n    }\n\n    protected function assertPostConditions(): void\n    {\n        fwrite(STDOUT, __METHOD__ . \"\\n\");\n    }\n\n    protected function tearDown(): void\n    {\n        fwrite(STDOUT, __METHOD__ . \"\\n\");\n    }\n\n    public static function tearDownAfterClass(): void\n    {\n        fwrite(STDOUT, __METHOD__ . \"\\n\");\n    }\n\n    protected function onNotSuccessfulTest(Throwable $t): void\n    {\n        fwrite(STDOUT, __METHOD__ . \"\\n\");\n        throw $t;\n    }\n}\n$ phpunit TemplateMethodsTest PHPUnit .0 by Sebastian Bergmann and\ncontributors.\nTemplateMethodsTest::setUpBeforeClass TemplateMethodsTest::setUp\nTemplateMethodsTest::assertPreConditions TemplateMethodsTest::testOne\nTemplateMethodsTest::assertPostConditions TemplateMethodsTest::tearDown\n.TemplateMethodsTest::setUp TemplateMethodsTest::assertPreConditions\nTemplateMethodsTest::testTwo TemplateMethodsTest::tearDown\nTemplateMethodsTest::onNotSuccessfulTest\nFTemplateMethodsTest::tearDownAfterClass\nTime: 0 seconds, Memory: 5.25Mb\nThere was 1 failure:\n1) TemplateMethodsTest::testTwo Failed asserting that\n is true. /home/sb/TemplateMethodsTest.php:30\nFAILURES! Tests: 2, Assertions: 2, Failures: 1.\nMore setUp() than tearDown()\nsetUp() and tearDown() are nicely symmetrical in theory but not in\npractice. In practice, you only need to implement tearDown() if you\nhave allocated external resources like files or sockets in setUp(). If\nyour setUp() just creates plain PHP objects, you can generally ignore\ntearDown(). However, if you create many objects in your setUp(), you\nmight want to unset() the variables pointing to those objects in your\ntearDown() so they can be garbage collected. The garbage collection of\ntest case objects is not predictable.\nVariations\nWhat happens when you have two tests with slightly different setups?\nThere are two possibilities:\n\nIf the setUp() code differs only slightly, move the code that\n\ndiffers from the setUp() code to the test method.\n\n\nIf you really have a different setUp(), you need a different test\n\ncase class. Name the class after the difference in the setup.\n\n\n\nSharing Fixture\nThere are few good reasons to share fixtures between tests, but in most\ncases the need to share a fixture between tests stems from an unresolved\ndesign problem.\nA good example of a fixture that makes sense to share across several\ntests is a database connection: you log into the database once and reuse\nthe database connection instead of creating a new connection for each\ntest. This makes your tests run faster.\nfixtures.sharing-fixture.examples.DatabaseTest.php uses the\nsetUpBeforeClass() and tearDownAfterClass() template methods to\nconnect to the database before the test case class' first test and to\ndisconnect from the database after the last test of the test case,\nrespectively.\nIt cannot be emphasized enough that sharing fixtures between tests\nreduces the value of the tests. The underlying design problem is that\nobjects are not loosely coupled. You will achieve better results solving\nthe underlying design problem and then writing tests using stubs (see\ntest-doubles), than by creating dependencies between tests at runtime\nand ignoring the opportunity to improve your design.\nGlobal State\nIt is hard to test code that uses\nsingletons.\nThe same is true for code that uses global variables. Typically, the\ncode you want to test is coupled strongly with a global variable and you\ncannot control its creation. An additional problem is the fact that one\ntest's change to a global variable might break another test.\nIn PHP, global variables work like this:\n\nA global variable $foo = 'bar'; is stored as\n\n$GLOBALS['foo'] = 'bar';.\n\n\nThe $GLOBALS variable is a so-called super-global variable.\n\nSuper-global variables are built-in variables that are always\n\navailable in all scopes.\n\n\nIn the scope of a function or method, you may access the global\n\nvariable $foo by either directly accessing $GLOBALS['foo'] or\nby using global $foo; to create a local variable with a\nreference to the global variable.\n\n\n\nBesides global variables, static attributes of classes are also part of\nthe global state.\nPrior to version 6, by default, PHPUnit ran your tests in a way where\nchanges to global and super-global variables ($GLOBALS, $_ENV,\n$_POST, $_GET, $_COOKIE, $_SERVER, $_FILES, $_REQUEST) do\nnot affect other tests.\nAs of version 6, PHPUnit does not perform this backup and restore\noperation for global and super-global variables by default anymore. It\ncan be activated by using the --globals-backup option or setting\nbackupGlobals=\"true\" in the XML configuration file.\nBy using the --static-backup option or setting\nbackupStaticAttributes=\"true\" in the XML configuration file, this\nisolation can be extended to static attributes of classes.\nNote\nThe backup and restore operations for global variables and static class\nattributes use serialize() and unserialize().\nObjects of some classes (e.g., PDO) cannot be serialized and the\nbackup operation will break when such an object is stored e.g. in the\n$GLOBALS array.\nThe @backupGlobals annotation that is discussed in\nappendixes.annotations.backupGlobals can be used to control the backup\nand restore operations for global variables. Alternatively, you can\nprovide a list of global variables that are to be excluded from the\nbackup and restore operations like this\nfinal class MyTest extends TestCase\n{\n    protected $backupGlobalsExcludeList = ['globalVariable'];\n\n    // ...\n}\nNote\nSetting the $backupGlobalsExcludeList property inside e.g. the\nsetUp() method has no effect.\nThe @backupStaticAttributes annotation discussed in\nappendixes.annotations.backupStaticAttributes can be used to back up\nall static property values in all declared classes before each test and\nrestore them afterwards.\nIt processes all classes that are declared at the time a test starts,\nnot only the test class itself. It only applies to static class\nproperties, not static variables within functions.\nNote\nThe @backupStaticAttributes operation is executed before a test\nmethod, but only if it is enabled. If a static value was changed by a\npreviously executed test that did not have @backupStaticAttributes\nenabled, then that value will be backed up and restored — not the\noriginally declared default value. PHP does not record the originally\ndeclared default value of any static variable.\nThe same applies to static properties of classes that were newly\nloaded/declared within a test. They cannot be reset to their originally\ndeclared default value after the test, since that value is unknown.\nWhichever value is set will leak into subsequent tests.\nFor unit tests, it is recommended to explicitly reset the values of\nstatic properties under test in your setUp() code instead (and ideally\nalso tearDown(), so as to not affect subsequently executed tests).\nYou can provide a list of static attributes that are to be excluded from\nthe backup and restore operations:\nfinal class MyTest extends TestCase\n{\n    protected $backupStaticAttributesExcludeList = [\n        'className' => ['attributeName']\n    ];\n\n    // ...\n}\nNote\nSetting the $backupStaticAttributesExcludeList property inside e.g.\nthe setUp() method has no effect.\n"},"incomplete-and-skipped-tests.html":{"url":"incomplete-and-skipped-tests.html","title":"Incomplete And Skipped Tests","keywords":"","body":"Incomplete and Skipped Tests\nIncomplete Tests\nWhen you are working on a new test case class, you might want to begin\nby writing empty test methods such as:\npublic function testSomething(): void\n{\n}\nto keep track of the tests that you have to write. The problem with\nempty test methods is that they are interpreted as a success by the\nPHPUnit framework. This misinterpretation leads to the test reports\nbeing useless -- you cannot see whether a test is actually successful or\njust not yet implemented. Calling $this->fail() in the unimplemented\ntest method does not help either, since then the test will be\ninterpreted as a failure. This would be just as wrong as interpreting an\nunimplemented test as a success.\nIf we think of a successful test as a green light and a test failure as\na red light, we need an additional yellow light to mark a test as being\nincomplete or not yet implemented.

Looking at this project's directory structure, we see that the\ntest case classes in the tests directory mirror the package and class\nstructure of the System Under Test (SUT) in the src directory:\nsrc                                 tests\n`-- Currency.php                    `-- CurrencyTest.php\n`-- IntlFormatter.php               `-- IntlFormatterTest.php\n`-- Money.php                       `-- MoneyTest.php\n`-- autoload.php\nTo run all tests for the library we need to point the PHPUnit\ncommand-line test runner to the test directory:\n$ phpunit --bootstrap src/autoload.php tests PHPUnit .0 by Sebastian\nBergmann and contributors.\n\nTime: 636 ms, Memory: 3.50Mb\nOK (33 tests, 52 assertions)\nNote\nIf you point the PHPUnit command-line test runner to a directory it will\nlook for *Test.php files.\nTo run only the tests that are declared in the CurrencyTest test case\nclass in tests/CurrencyTest.php we can use the following command:\n$ phpunit --bootstrap src/autoload.php tests/CurrencyTest.php PHPUnit .0\nby Sebastian Bergmann and contributors.\n\nTime: 280 ms, Memory: 2.75Mb\nOK (8 tests, 8 assertions)\nFor more fine-grained control of which tests to run we can use the\n--filter option:\n$ phpunit --bootstrap src/autoload.php --filter\ntestObjectCanBeConstructedForValidConstructorArgument tests PHPUnit .0\nby Sebastian Bergmann and contributors.\nTime: 167 ms, Memory: 3.00Mb\nOK (2 test, 2 assertions)\nNote\nA drawback of this approach is that we have no control over the order in\nwhich the tests are run. This can lead to problems with regard to test\ndependencies, see writing-tests-for-phpunit.test-dependencies. In the\nnext section you will see how you can make the test execution order\nexplicit by using the XML configuration file.\nComposing a Test Suite Using XML Configuration\nPHPUnit's XML configuration file (appendixes.configuration) can also\nbe used to compose a test suite.\norganizing-tests.xml-configuration.examples.phpunit.xml shows a\nminimal phpunit.xml file that will add all *Test classes that are\nfound in *Test.php files when the tests directory is recursively\ntraversed.\n\n  \n    \n      tests\n    \n  \n\nTo run the test suite, use the the --testsuite option:\n$ phpunit --bootstrap src/autoload.php --testsuite money PHPUnit .0 by\nSebastian Bergmann and contributors.\nTime: 167 ms, Memory: 3.00Mb\nOK (2 test, 2 assertions)\nIf phpunit.xml or phpunit.xml.dist (in that order) exist in the\ncurrent working directory and --configuration is not used, the\nconfiguration will be automatically read from that file.\nThe order in which tests are executed can be made explicit:\n\n  \n    \n      tests/IntlFormatterTest.php\n      tests/MoneyTest.php\n      tests/CurrencyTest.php\n    \n  \n\n"},"risky-tests.html":{"url":"risky-tests.html","title":"Risky Tests","keywords":"","body":"Risky Tests\nPHPUnit can perform the additional checks documented below while it\nexecutes the tests.\nUseless Tests\nPHPUnit is by default strict about tests that do not test anything. This\ncheck can be disabled by using the --dont-report-useless-tests option\non the command line  or by setting\nbeStrictAboutTestsThatDoNotTestAnything=\"false\" in PHPUnit's\nconfiguration file .\nA test that does not perform an assertion will be marked as risky when\nthis check is enabled.

This could be because they aren't available, they will\nnot return the results needed for the test or because executing them\nwould have undesirable side effects. In other cases, our test strategy\nrequires us to have more control or visibility of the internal\nbehavior of the SUT.\nWhen we are writing a test in which we cannot (or chose not to) use a\nreal depended-on component (DOC), we can replace it with a Test\nDouble. The Test Double doesn't have to behave exactly like the real\nDOC; it merely has to provide the same API as the real one so that the\nSUT thinks it is the real one!\n\nThe createStub($type), createMock($type), and\ngetMockBuilder($type) methods provided by PHPUnit can be used in a\ntest to automatically generate an object that can act as a test double\nfor the specified original type (interface or class name). This test\ndouble object can be used in every context where an object of the\noriginal type is expected or required.\nThe createStub($type) and createMock($type) method immediately\nreturn a test double object for the specified type (interface or class).\nThe creation of this test double is performed using best practice\ndefaults. The __construct() and __clone() methods of the original\nclass are not executed and the arguments passed to a method of the test\ndouble will not be cloned. If these defaults are not what you need then\nyou can use the getMockBuilder($type) method to customize the test\ndouble generation using a fluent interface.\nBy default, all methods of the original class are replaced with a dummy\nimplementation that returns null (without calling the original\nmethod). Using the will($this->returnValue()) method, for instance,\nyou can configure these dummy implementations to return a value when\ncalled.\nLimitation: final, private, and static methods\nPlease note that final, private, and static methods cannot be\nstubbed or mocked. They are ignored by PHPUnit's test double\nfunctionality and retain their original behavior except for static\nmethods that will be replaced by a method throwing a\n\\PHPUnit\\Framework\\MockObject\\BadMethodCallException exception.\nStubs\nThe practice of replacing an object with a test double that (optionally)\nreturns configured return values is referred to as stubbing. You can\nuse a stub to \"replace a real component on which the SUT depends so\nthat the test has a control point for the indirect inputs of the SUT.\nThis allows the test to force the SUT down paths it might not otherwise\nexecute\".\ntest-doubles.stubs.examples.StubTest.php shows how to stub method\ncalls and set up return values. We first use the createStub() method\nthat is provided by the PHPUnit\\Framework\\TestCase class to set up a\nstub object that looks like an object of SomeClass\n(test-doubles.stubs.examples.SomeClass.php). We then use the Fluent\nInterface that\nPHPUnit provides to specify the behavior for the stub. In essence, this\nmeans that you do not need to create several temporary objects and wire\nthem together afterwards. Instead, you chain method calls as shown in\nthe example. This leads to more readable and \"fluent\" code.\ncreateStub(SomeClass::class);\n\n        // Configure the stub.\n        $stub->method('doSomething')\n             ->willReturn('foo');\n\n        // Calling $stub->doSomething() will now return\n        // 'foo'.\n        $this->assertSame('foo', $stub->doSomething());\n    }\n}\nLimitation: Methods named \"method\"\nThe example shown above only works when the original class does not\ndeclare a method named \"method\".\nIf the original class does declare a method named \"method\" then\n$stub->expects($this->any())->method('doSomething')->willReturn('foo');\nhas to be used.\n\"Behind the scenes\", PHPUnit automatically generates a new PHP class\nthat implements the desired behavior when the createStub() method is\nused.\nPlease note that createStub() will automatically and recursively stub\nreturn values based on a method's return type. Consider the example\nshown below:\nIn the example shown above, the C::m() method has a return type\ndeclaration indicating that this method returns an object of type D.\nWhen a test double for C is created and no return value is configured\nfor m() using willReturn() (see above), for instance, then when\nm() is invoked PHPUnit will automatically create a test double for D\nto be returned.\nSimilarily, if m had a return type declaration for a scalar type then\na return value such as 0 (for int), 0.0 (for float), or []\n(for array) would be generated.\ntest-doubles.stubs.examples.StubTest2.php shows an example of how to\nuse the Mock Builder's fluent interface to configure the creation of the\ntest double. The configuration of this test double uses the same best\npractice defaults used by createStub().\ngetMockBuilder(SomeClass::class)\n                     ->disableOriginalConstructor()\n                     ->disableOriginalClone()\n                     ->disableArgumentCloning()\n                     ->disallowMockingUnknownTypes()\n                     ->getMock();\n\n        // Configure the stub.\n        $stub->method('doSomething')\n             ->willReturn('foo');\n\n        // Calling $stub->doSomething() will now return\n        // 'foo'.\n        $this->assertSame('foo', $stub->doSomething());\n    }\n}\nIn the examples so far we have been returning simple values using\nwillReturn($value). This short syntax is the same as\nwill($this->returnValue($value)). We can use variations on this longer\nsyntax to achieve more complex stubbing behaviour.\nSometimes you want to return one of the arguments of a method call\n(unchanged) as the result of a stubbed method call.\ntest-doubles.stubs.examples.StubTest3.php shows how you can achieve\nthis using returnArgument() instead of returnValue().\ncreateStub(SomeClass::class);\n\n        // Configure the stub.\n        $stub->method('doSomething')\n             ->will($this->returnArgument(0));\n\n        // $stub->doSomething('foo') returns 'foo'\n        $this->assertSame('foo', $stub->doSomething('foo'));\n\n        // $stub->doSomething('bar') returns 'bar'\n        $this->assertSame('bar', $stub->doSomething('bar'));\n    }\n}\nWhen testing a fluent interface, it is sometimes useful to have a\nstubbed method return a reference to the stubbed object.\ntest-doubles.stubs.examples.StubTest4.php shows how you can use\nreturnSelf() to achieve this.\ncreateStub(SomeClass::class);\n\n        // Configure the stub.\n        $stub->method('doSomething')\n             ->will($this->returnSelf());\n\n        // $stub->doSomething() returns $stub\n        $this->assertSame($stub, $stub->doSomething());\n    }\n}\nSometimes a stubbed method should return different values depending on a\npredefined list of arguments. You can use returnValueMap() to create a\nmap that associates arguments with corresponding return values. See\ntest-doubles.stubs.examples.StubTest5.php for an example.\ncreateStub(SomeClass::class);\n\n        // Create a map of arguments to return values.\n        $map = [\n            ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd'],\n            ['e', 'f', 'g', 'h']\n        ];\n\n        // Configure the stub.\n        $stub->method('doSomething')\n             ->will($this->returnValueMap($map));\n\n        // $stub->doSomething() returns different values depending on\n        // the provided arguments.\n        $this->assertSame('d', $stub->doSomething('a', 'b', 'c'));\n        $this->assertSame('h', $stub->doSomething('e', 'f', 'g'));\n    }\n}\nWhen the stubbed method call should return a calculated value instead of\na fixed one (see returnValue()) or an (unchanged) argument (see\nreturnArgument()), you can use returnCallback() to have the stubbed\nmethod return the result of a callback function or method. See\ntest-doubles.stubs.examples.StubTest6.php for an example.\ncreateStub(SomeClass::class);\n\n        // Configure the stub.\n        $stub->method('doSomething')\n             ->will($this->returnCallback('str_rot13'));\n\n        // $stub->doSomething($argument) returns str_rot13($argument)\n        $this->assertSame('fbzrguvat', $stub->doSomething('something'));\n    }\n}\nA simpler alternative to setting up a callback method may be to specify\na list of desired return values. You can do this with the\nonConsecutiveCalls() method. See\ntest-doubles.stubs.examples.StubTest7.php for an example.\ncreateStub(SomeClass::class);\n\n        // Configure the stub.\n        $stub->method('doSomething')\n             ->will($this->onConsecutiveCalls(2, 3, 5, 7));\n\n        // $stub->doSomething() returns a different value each time\n        $this->assertSame(2, $stub->doSomething());\n        $this->assertSame(3, $stub->doSomething());\n        $this->assertSame(5, $stub->doSomething());\n    }\n}\nInstead of returning a value, a stubbed method can also raise an\nexception. test-doubles.stubs.examples.StubTest8.php shows how to use\nthrowException() to do this.\ncreateStub(SomeClass::class);\n\n        // Configure the stub.\n        $stub->method('doSomething')\n             ->will($this->throwException(new Exception));\n\n        // $stub->doSomething() throws Exception\n        $stub->doSomething();\n    }\n}\nAlternatively, you can write the stub yourself and improve your design\nalong the way. Widely used resources are accessed through a single\nfaçade, so you can replace the resource with the stub. For example,\ninstead of having direct database calls scattered throughout the code,\nyou have a single Database object, an implementor of the IDatabase\ninterface. Then, you can create a stub implementation of IDatabase and\nuse it for your tests. You can even create an option for running the\ntests with the stub database or the real database, so you can use your\ntests for both local testing during development and integration testing\nwith the real database.\nFunctionality that needs to be stubbed out tends to cluster in the same\nobject, improving cohesion. By presenting the functionality with a\nsingle, coherent interface you reduce the coupling with the rest of the\nsystem.\nMock Objects\nThe practice of replacing an object with a test double that verifies\nexpectations, for instance asserting that a method has been called, is\nreferred to as mocking.\nYou can use a mock object \"as an observation point that is used to\nverify the indirect outputs of the SUT as it is exercised. Typically,\nthe mock object also includes the functionality of a test stub in that\nit must return values to the SUT if it hasn't already failed the tests\nbut the emphasis is on the verification of the indirect outputs.\nTherefore, a mock object is a lot more than just a test stub plus\nassertions; it is used in a fundamentally different way\" (Gerard\nMeszaros).\nLimitation: Automatic verification of expectations\nOnly mock objects generated within the scope of a test will be verified\nautomatically by PHPUnit. Mock objects generated in data providers, for\ninstance, or injected into the test using the @depends annotation will\nnot be verified automatically by PHPUnit.\nHere is an example: suppose we want to test that the correct method,\nupdate() in our example, is called on an object that observes another\nobject. test-doubles.mock-objects.examples.SUT.php shows the code for\nthe Subject and Observer classes that are part of the System under\nTest (SUT).\nname = $name;\n    }\n\n    public function getName()\n    {\n        return $this->name;\n    }\n\n    public function attach(Observer $observer)\n    {\n        $this->observers[] = $observer;\n    }\n\n    public function doSomething()\n    {\n        // Do something.\n        // ...\n\n        // Notify observers that we did something.\n        $this->notify('something');\n    }\n\n    public function doSomethingBad()\n    {\n        foreach ($this->observers as $observer) {\n            $observer->reportError(42, 'Something bad happened', $this);\n        }\n    }\n\n    protected function notify($argument)\n    {\n        foreach ($this->observers as $observer) {\n            $observer->update($argument);\n        }\n    }\n\n    // Other methods.\n}\n\nclass Observer\n{\n    public function update($argument)\n    {\n        // Do something.\n    }\n\n    public function reportError($errorCode, $errorMessage, Subject $subject)\n    {\n        // Do something\n    }\n\n    // Other methods.\n}\ntest-doubles.mock-objects.examples.SubjectTest.php shows how to use a\nmock object to test the interaction between Subject and Observer\nobjects.\nWe first use the createMock() method that is provided by the\nPHPUnit\\Framework\\TestCase class to set up a mock object for the\nObserver.\nBecause we are interested in verifying that a method is called, and\nwhich arguments it is called with, we introduce the expects() and\nwith() methods to specify how this interaction should look.\ncreateMock(Observer::class);\n\n        // Set up the expectation for the update() method\n        // to be called only once and with the string 'something'\n        // as its parameter.\n        $observer->expects($this->once())\n                 ->method('update')\n                 ->with($this->equalTo('something'));\n\n        // Create a Subject object and attach the mocked\n        // Observer object to it.\n        $subject = new Subject('My subject');\n        $subject->attach($observer);\n\n        // Call the doSomething() method on the $subject object\n        // which we expect to call the mocked Observer object's\n        // update() method with the string 'something'.\n        $subject->doSomething();\n    }\n}\nThe with() method can take any number of arguments, corresponding to\nthe number of arguments to the method being mocked. You can specify more\nadvanced constraints on the method's arguments than a simple match.\ncreateMock(Observer::class);\n\n        $observer->expects($this->once())\n                 ->method('reportError')\n                 ->with(\n                       $this->greaterThan(0),\n                       $this->stringContains('Something'),\n                       $this->anything()\n                   );\n\n        $subject = new Subject('My subject');\n        $subject->attach($observer);\n\n        // The doSomethingBad() method should report an error to the observer\n        // via the reportError() method\n        $subject->doSomethingBad();\n    }\n}\nThe withConsecutive() method can take any number of arrays of\narguments, depending on the calls you want to test against. Each array\nis a list of constraints corresponding to the arguments of the method\nbeing mocked, like in with().\ngetMockBuilder(stdClass::class)\n                     ->setMethods(['set'])\n                     ->getMock();\n\n        $mock->expects($this->exactly(2))\n             ->method('set')\n             ->withConsecutive(\n                 [$this->equalTo('foo'), $this->greaterThan(0)],\n                 [$this->equalTo('bar'), $this->greaterThan(0)]\n             );\n\n        $mock->set('foo', 21);\n        $mock->set('bar', 48);\n    }\n}\nThe callback() constraint can be used for more complex argument\nverification. This constraint takes a PHP callback as its only argument.\nThe PHP callback will receive the argument to be verified as its only\nargument and should return true if the argument passes verification\nand false otherwise.\ncreateMock(Observer::class);\n\n        $observer->expects($this->once())\n                 ->method('reportError')\n                 ->with(\n                     $this->greaterThan(0),\n                     $this->stringContains('Something'),\n                     $this->callback(function($subject)\n                     {\n                         return is_callable([$subject, 'getName']) &&\n                                $subject->getName() == 'My subject';\n                     }\n                 ));\n\n        $subject = new Subject('My subject');\n        $subject->attach($observer);\n\n        // The doSomethingBad() method should report an error to the observer\n        // via the reportError() method\n        $subject->doSomethingBad();\n    }\n}\n\ngetMockBuilder(stdClass::class)\n                     ->setMethods(['foo'])\n                     ->getMock();\n\n        $mock->expects($this->once())\n             ->method('foo')\n             ->with($this->identicalTo($expectedObject));\n\n        $mock->foo($expectedObject);\n    }\n}\n\ngetMockBuilder(stdClass::class)\n                     ->enableArgumentCloning()\n                     ->getMock();\n\n        // now your mock clones parameters so the identicalTo constraint\n        // will fail.\n    }\n}\nappendixes.assertions.assertThat.tables.constraints shows the\nconstraints that can be applied to method arguments and\ntest-doubles.mock-objects.tables.matchers shows the matchers that are\navailable to specify the number of invocations.\ntable\n\nMatchers\n\n\nMatcher\nMeaning\n\n\n\n\nPHPUnit\\Framework\\MockObject\\Matcher\\AnyInvokedCount any()\nReturns a matcher that matches when the method it is evaluated for is executed zero or more times.\n\n\nPHPUnit\\Framework\\MockObject\\Matcher\\InvokedCount never()\nReturns a matcher that matches when the method it is evaluated for is never executed.\n\n\nPHPUnit\\Framework\\MockObject\\Matcher\\InvokedAtLeastOnce atLeastOnce()\nReturns a matcher that matches when the method it is evaluated for is executed at least once.\n\n\nPHPUnit\\Framework\\MockObject\\Matcher\\InvokedCount once()\nReturns a matcher that matches when the method it is evaluated for is executed exactly once.\n\n\nPHPUnit\\Framework\\MockObject\\Matcher\\InvokedCount exactly(int $count)\nReturns a matcher that matches when the method it is evaluated for is executed exactly $count times.\n\n\nPHPUnit\\Framework\\MockObject\\Matcher\\InvokedAtIndex at(int $index)\nReturns a matcher that matches when the method it is evaluated for is invoked at the given $index.\n\n\n\n\nNote\nThe $index parameter for the at() matcher refers to the index,\nstarting at zero, in all method invocations for a given mock object.\nExercise caution when using this matcher as it can lead to brittle tests\nwhich are too closely tied to specific implementation details.\nAs mentioned in the beginning, when the defaults used by the\ncreateStub() and createMock() methods to generate the test double do\nnot match your needs then you can use the getMockBuilder($type) method\nto customize the test double generation using a fluent interface. Here\nis a list of methods provided by the Mock Builder:\n\nsetMethods(array $methods) can be called on the Mock Builder\n\nobject to specify the methods that are to be replaced with a\nconfigurable test double.

To achieve these benefits, unit\ntests ideally should cover all the possible paths in a program. One\nunit test usually covers one specific path in one function or method.\nHowever a test method is not necessarily an encapsulated, independent\nentity. Often there are implicit dependencies between test methods,\nhidden in the implementation scenario of a test.\n\nPHPUnit supports the declaration of explicit dependencies between test\nmethods. Such dependencies do not define the order in which the test\nmethods are to be executed but they allow the returning of an instance\nof the test fixture by a producer and passing it to the dependent\nconsumers.\n\nA producer is a test method that yields its unit under test as\n\nreturn value.\n\n\nA consumer is a test method that depends on one or more producers\n\nand their return values.\n\n\n\nwriting-tests-for-phpunit.examples.StackTest2.php shows how to use the\n@depends annotation to express dependencies between test methods.\nassertEmpty($stack);\n\n        return $stack;\n    }\n\n    /**\n     * @depends testEmpty\n     */\n    public function testPush(array $stack): array\n    {\n        array_push($stack, 'foo');\n        $this->assertSame('foo', $stack[count($stack)-1]);\n        $this->assertNotEmpty($stack);\n\n        return $stack;\n    }\n\n    /**\n     * @depends testPush\n     */\n    public function testPop(array $stack): void\n    {\n        $this->assertSame('foo', array_pop($stack));\n        $this->assertEmpty($stack);\n    }\n}\nIn the example above, the first test, testEmpty(), creates a new array\nand asserts that it is empty. The test then returns the fixture as its\nresult. The second test, testPush(), depends on testEmpty() and is\npassed the result of that depended-upon test as its argument. Finally,\ntestPop() depends upon testPush().\nNote\nThe return value yielded by a producer is passed \"as-is\" to its\nconsumers by default. This means that when a producer returns an object,\na reference to that object is passed to the consumers. Instead of a\nreference either (a) a (deep) copy via @depends clone, or (b) a\n(normal shallow) clone (based on PHP keyword clone) via\n@depends shallowClone are possible too.\nTo localize defects, we want our attention to be focussed on relevant\nfailing tests. This is why PHPUnit skips the execution of a test when a\ndepended-upon test has failed. This improves defect localization by\nexploiting the dependencies between tests as shown in\nwriting-tests-for-phpunit.examples.DependencyFailureTest.php.\nassertTrue(false);\n    }\n\n    /**\n     * @depends testOne\n     */\n    public function testTwo(): void\n    {\n    }\n}\n$ phpunit --verbose DependencyFailureTest PHPUnit .0 by Sebastian\nBergmann and contributors.\nFS\nTime: 0 seconds, Memory: 5.00Mb\nThere was 1 failure:\n1) DependencyFailureTest::testOne Failed asserting that false is true.\n/home/sb/DependencyFailureTest.php:6\nThere was 1 skipped test:\n1) DependencyFailureTest::testTwo This test depends on\n\"DependencyFailureTest::testOne\" to pass.\nFAILURES!

Tests: 6, Assertions: 6, Failures: 1.\nNote\nWhen a test depends on a test that uses data providers, the depending\ntest will be executed when the test it depends upon is successful for at\nleast one data set. The result of a test that uses data providers cannot\nbe injected into a depending test.\nNote\nAll data providers are executed before both the call to the\nsetUpBeforeClass() static method and the first call to the setUp()\nmethod. Because of that you can't access any variables you create there\nfrom within a data provider. This is required in order for PHPUnit to be\nable to compute the total number of tests.\nTesting Exceptions\nwriting-tests-for-phpunit.exceptions.examples.ExceptionTest.php shows\nhow to use the expectException() method to test whether an exception\nis thrown by the code under test.\nexpectException(InvalidArgumentException::class);\n    }\n}\n$ phpunit ExceptionTest PHPUnit .0 by Sebastian Bergmann and\ncontributors.\nF\nTime: 0 seconds, Memory: 4.75Mb\nThere was 1 failure:\n1) ExceptionTest::testException Failed asserting that exception of type\n\"InvalidArgumentException\" is thrown.\nFAILURES! Tests: 1, Assertions: 1, Failures: 1.\nIn addition to the expectException() method the\nexpectExceptionCode(), expectExceptionMessage(), and\nexpectExceptionMessageMatches() methods exist to set up expectations\nfor exceptions raised by the code under test.\nNote\nNote that expectExceptionMessage() asserts that the $actual message\ncontains the $expected message and does not perform an exact string\ncomparison.\nTesting PHP Errors, Warnings, and Notices\nBy default, PHPUnit converts PHP errors, warnings, and notices that are\ntriggered during the execution of a test to an exception. Among other\nbenefits, this makes it possible to expect that a PHP error, warning, or\nnotice is triggered in a test as shown in\nwriting-tests-for-phpunit.exceptions.examples.ErrorTest.php.\nNote\nPHP's error_reporting runtime configuration can limit which errors\nPHPUnit will convert to exceptions. If you are having issues with this\nfeature, be sure PHP is not configured to suppress the type of error you\nare interested in.\nexpectDeprecation();\n\n        // Optionally test that the message is equal to a string\n        $this->expectDeprecationMessage('foo');\n\n        // Or optionally test that the message matches a regular expression\n        $this->expectDeprecationMessageMatches('/foo/');\n\n        \\trigger_error('foo', \\E_USER_DEPRECATED);\n    }\n\n    public function testNoticeCanBeExpected(): void\n    {\n        $this->expectNotice();\n\n        // Optionally test that the message is equal to a string\n        $this->expectNoticeMessage('foo');\n\n        // Or optionally test that the message matches a regular expression\n        $this->expectNoticeMessageMatches('/foo/');\n\n        \\trigger_error('foo', \\E_USER_NOTICE);\n    }\n\n    public function testWarningCanBeExpected(): void\n    {\n        $this->expectWarning();\n\n        // Optionally test that the message is equal to a string\n        $this->expectWarningMessage('foo');\n\n        // Or optionally test that the message matches a regular expression\n        $this->expectWarningMessageMatches('/foo/');\n\n        \\trigger_error('foo', \\E_USER_WARNING);\n    }\n\n    public function testErrorCanBeExpected(): void\n    {\n        $this->expectError();\n\n        // Optionally test that the message is equal to a string\n        $this->expectErrorMessage('foo');\n\n        // Or optionally test that the message matches a regular expression\n        $this->expectErrorMessageMatches('/foo/');\n\n        \\trigger_error('foo', \\E_USER_ERROR);\n    }\n}\nWhen testing code that uses PHP built-in functions such as fopen()\nthat may trigger errors it can sometimes be useful to use error\nsuppression while testing.
